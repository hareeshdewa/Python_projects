The above Projects I mentioned represent a rudimentary foundation using Python 
that runs on the console-based format and 
is illustrated in an understandable manner using elemental data structures. 

1. Project-> Adventure:
This is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game implemented in Python. 
The code presents an adventure scenario where the player navigates through various choices and outcomes based on their decisions.

2. Project-> Number Guess:
This project is a number-guessing game implemented in Python. 
The game allows the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

3. Project-> Quiz Game:
This project is an uncomplicated quiz game in Python. It prompts the user with several 
questions related to computer acronyms and provide feedback based on the answers.
The game also calculates the score and percentage of correct answers.

4. Project-> Rock, Paper, and Scissors:
The design is a simple implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. 
The game allows the user to play against the computer and keeps track of the number of times the user and the computer win.

5. Project -> Anagram:
This project is a program in Python to check whether two words are anagrams or not. 
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

6. Project -> Calculator:
This Project defines a simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. 
The code also utilizes a decorator to enhance the user experience by providing a prompt to continue using the calculator after each operation.
